# Introduction 
This is a Roku channel for Kino.pub. The author of this chanel has no affiliation with Kino.pub. I have put this channel together simply to have some fun and make watching this service possible through Roku.

Right now only dev mode install is supported. If there is enough demand I will try to get the channel to Roku channel store.

# If you only want to install it
1) Switch your Roku into the [dev mode](https://developer.roku.com/develop/getting-started/setup-guide).
2) Download the release of your choice as a zip file.
3) Go to to the application installer from 1). Upload the zip file and enjoy.

# Getting Started
To get started you need a couple of things.
1) Get yourself an IDE. There is a good plugin for Eclipse. There is a plugin for VS Code (I can't call it good but...)
2) Switch your Roku into dev mode. This is described above.
3) [Have fun.](https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Roku+SDK+Documentation)
4) Build and deploy using your IDE (or manually)
